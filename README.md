# Curbside

_Formerly "Urban Blight" (renamed 2026-10-29; other games already use that name)._

Top-down open-world crime/driving game for the browser — three.js, TypeScript,
Vite, installable as a PWA. Full plan: `docs/PLAN.md` (mirrored as `PLAN.md` in the Google Drive folder
*GameDev / Curbside*, which also holds art; code lives here).

## Run

Needs Node ≥ 22.12 (hive1: `~/.local/opt/node24/bin`, the system Node 20 is too old).

```sh
npm install          # if NODE_ENV=production is set, unset it first or dev deps are skipped
npm run dev          # vite --host, http://<host>:5173
npm test             # vitest (physics, loop)
npm run build        # typecheck + production build with service worker
npm run icons        # regenerate PWA icons
npm run assets       # rebuild GLBs from blender/ (needs `blender` on PATH; add `-- --thumbs` for previews)
```

On hive1 the dev server runs as the user unit `curbside-dev` (enabled, starts on boot;
`systemctl --user status|restart|stop curbside-dev`). Open
`https://hive1.tail078432.ts.net:8443` (tailscale serve → :5173) or
`http://hive1:5173` from a device on the tailnet.

## Status

- **M0 Setup** — done, verified on a phone over Tailscale: Vite 8 + three 0.186 + TS + vite-plugin-pwa, Vitest.
- **M1 Drive a box** — done: fixed-timestep loop with render interpolation,
  arcade car physics (`src/entities/vehicle.ts`, pure + unit-tested),
  speed-zoom chase camera, keyboard/touch/gamepad input, placeholder road-grid
  world with non-colliding blocks, dynamic resolution, pause on background.
- **M3 Blender pipeline** — started: `blender/build_assets.py` runs generators headless;
  `characters.py` builds the player (rigid parts on an armature, Idle + Walk
  clips) → `public/assets/player.glb`, loaded with GLTFLoader + AnimationMixer.
  `vehicles.py` builds five parametric cars (sedan, compact, sports, van,
  police) → `public/assets/vehicles.glb`; the game tints the `paint` material
  per car and steers the `*_wheel_F*` nodes. Each archetype has its own
  handling (`VEHICLE_SPECS`). Road tiles and building kits still to do.
- **M4 On foot** — started: screen-relative walking/sprinting
  (`src/entities/pedestrian.ts`), enter/exit any nearby slow car, three parked
  cars to take. Punching and weapons still to do.
- **M2 City v1** — done: seeded 16×16-block city (`src/world/city.ts`) with
  lot subdivision, alleys, parks/trees, plazas and boundary walls; rendered as
  per-chunk instanced meshes with shader-painted windows; cars and the player
  collide with buildings, trees, walls and each other (`src/systems/physics.ts`).
- **M5 Living city** — v1 done: AI traffic (`src/systems/traffic.ts`) drives
  the right-hand lanes of the road grid (`src/world/roads.ts`), turns at
  intersections, brakes for cars/people ahead, with a gridlock breaker;
  sidewalk crowd (`src/systems/crowd.ts`) strolls blocks, crosses at
  crosswalks, dodges speeding cars, gets knocked down and runs.
  `src/game/population.ts` keeps ~16 cars / ~14 peds around the player.
  Carjacking: E next to an AI car throws the driver out.
  Car models are merged per material on load (~8 draw calls per car).
- **Damage** (`src/systems/damage.ts`, `src/render/effects.ts`): crashes
  cost health (bar under the speedo); smoking → burning → explosion →
  charred wreck; blasts damage/shove cars and knock people down; NPC
  drivers bail out of burning cars; your own car throws you clear.
- **Punching**: knocks down whoever is in front, scares bystanders.
- **Chaos score** (`src/systems/score.ts`, `src/ui/scoreHud.ts`): drifts,
  near misses, smashes, hit-and-runs, knockouts, carjacks and explosions
  score points; anything within 3 s of the last event raises a ×2…×10
  combo. Best score is kept in localStorage (`curbside.best`).
- **Weapons** (`src/systems/weapons.ts`, `src/world/pickups.ts`): pistol,
  SMG, shotgun and health crates on sidewalks (respawn 30 s); hitscan with
  aim assist, tracers, walls stop bullets, cars take damage.
- **Fighting back** (`src/systems/crowd.ts`): peds are calm (70%),
  fighters (20%) or armed (10%); provoke one and they punch or shoot back
  (shooters hit your car too). Player health; at 0 → WASTED, respawn, lose
  weapons, run score resets (best kept).
- Traffic 24 cars incl. new **taxi** and **pickup**; crowd 22, spawned
  just off-screen (never inside the camera's ground rectangle) and
  concentrated near the player; parked/abandoned cars are capped and
  everything is recycled, so the car list stays bounded. The five cars
  parked at the spawn corner are put back on every respawn.
- **Event bus** (`src/core/events.ts`): the simulation emits crash,
  explosion, shot, bulletHit, punch, pedDown, carjack, enter/exitVehicle,
  pickup, award, weaponSwitch, playerHurt/Died, respawn and pause events;
  presentation (HUD, effects, audio) subscribes. Player transitions live
  in `src/game/player.ts`.
- **Quality tiers** (`src/render/quality.ts`): high / medium / low, 'auto'
  picks medium on phones. Each tier has its own pixel-ratio cap, so
  `DynamicResolution` steps down e.g. medium@1.5x → low@1.25x → low@1x on
  a phone (never below 1x on high-DPI screens), keeps going past effects-only
  steps that don't help a fill-bound GPU, and treats a steady 30 Hz (Low
  Power Mode) as a cap, not overload.
- App updates wait for respawn, the page being hidden, or "restart now" on
  the pause screen; a lost WebGL context pauses until it's restored.
  `?debug` in the URL shows fps / pixel ratio / draw calls.
- **Audio** (`src/audio/`): fully synthesised Web Audio, no sound files —
  engine with a gearbox, tyres, guns, impacts, explosions, fire, sirens,
  city ambience, stingers tuned to the music, and an adaptive procedural
  soundtrack on three radio stations. See *Audio* below.
- **Look** (`src/render/look.ts` and friends): ACES tone mapping with a
  light grade, a sun shadow map fitted to the view every frame, a 12-minute
  day/night cycle (starts late afternoon → golden hour → night), analytic
  ground and building shaders (road markings, kerbs, paving, roofs by type,
  windows, shopfronts, five district palettes), rooftop props, street lamps
  that light the ground at night, neon, headlights, desktop bloom — with
  every person, car and glow batched into a handful of draw calls. See
  *Look* below.
- Next: **M6 Heat** (wanted level, police).

src/render    camera rig, meshes, dynamic resolution
src/world     ground / city
src/ui        touch controls, HUD, radio card, CSS

```

## Audio

Everything is synthesised at runtime with the Web Audio API: no audio files,
no dependencies. `GameAudio` (`src/audio/gameAudio.ts`) owns it all; `main.ts`
only creates it, feeds it one mutable `AudioFrame` per frame and forwards pause.

- **Unlock and lifecycle.** One `AudioContext`, created on the first
  tap / click / key (iOS needs a user gesture; a one-sample silent buffer
  completes the unlock). Only that happens inside the gesture handler: noise
  buffers, the reverb impulse and the graph are built in the next few tasks,
  so the first touch doesn't drop frames. Interrupted or suspended contexts
  resume on the next gesture. A hidden page suspends it; pausing silences the
  world and muffles the music (UI sounds still play), and 45 s of pause
  suspends it to save battery. Master volume at 0 keeps the context
  suspended; music volume at 0 stops the sequencer and unhooks the music
  graph, so muted music costs no CPU.
- **iOS audio session.** On iOS 16.4+ `navigator.audioSession.type` is
  `'playback'`, so the silent switch doesn't mute the game (setting
  `ignoreSilentSwitch`; false → `'ambient'`). `'playback'` also stops other
  apps' audio, so while the game is turned all the way down (master 0, or
  SFX and music both 0) it drops to `'ambient'` and the player's own music
  keeps playing. A sound-settings screen should explain the toggle as "Play
  sound with the silent switch on".
- **Mix.** World sounds (muted on pause, muffled by close blasts, hits and
  death, with a synthetic street reverb) and UI/stingers → SFX bus; music →
  its own bus; both → master → glue compressor → limiter. Bus gains follow
  `settings.masterVolume / sfxVolume / musicVolume` (squared slider curve).
  The world muffle and the music duck are each one merged state (`Dip` in
  `mix.ts`): the deepest pull wins and the longest hold is kept, so a hurt in
  the same frame as a close blast or the killing blow can't cut the blast's
  deafening or the WASTED muffle short.
- **Spatial.** One-shots are placed relative to the camera focus: inverse
  distance falloff with a floor (far events are quiet, not silent), stereo pan
  by screen x, air-absorption lowpass and more reverb with distance. Sirens
  also get doppler.
- **Budget.** One-shots are capped per category (oldest stolen) and overall,
  rate-gated per event type (a 30-car chain reaction makes two booms), and
  every node is disconnected when its voice ends; `audio.debug` shows live
  node and voice counts. Continuous voices push parameters at ~45 Hz.
- **Events.** It subscribes to every `GameEvent` on the bus (`src/core/events.ts`);
  nothing in the simulation calls it directly.
- **Music.** A look-ahead scheduler (25 ms timer, 0.12 s ahead on the audio
  clock) plays original 8-bar progressions in three styles: NIGHTDRIVE FM
  (synthwave), BREAKNECK 99.1 (breakbeat), LOW TIDE (lo-fi). Intensity 0–5
  layers in kick, snare, arps, lead, crashes and risers, opens the filter and
  lifts the tempo; changes land on bar lines with a fill, tempo glides. It
  follows chaos (combos, explosions, speed) above a floor set with
  `setIntensity`. `'menu'` mode is a drumless arrangement for a title screen.

| Module | What |
|---|---|
| `carSound.ts` | 5-speed gearbox / RPM model, per-archetype engine profiles, squeal and road-noise amounts (pure, tested) |
| `mix.ts`, `voices.ts`, `chaos.ts` | falloff/pan/doppler math, voice limiter and rate gate, chaos → intensity (pure, tested) |
| `music/theory.ts`, `music/stations.ts`, `music/sequencer.ts` | chords, voice leading, lead composer, station data, step clock and arranger (pure, tested) |
| `synth.ts` | noise buffers, node-tracking `Voice`, envelopes, reverb impulse |
| `sfx.ts`, `loops.ts`, `music/musicPlayer.ts` | one-shot recipes, continuous voices (engine, tyres, fire, ambience, sirens), music instruments |

API for other systems:

```ts
audio.update(dt, frame)              // per frame: listener x/z, player car (describeCar) or null, footSpeed, health, vehicles (fires)
audio.siren(id, x, z, on, style?)    // call every frame while it sounds; 'twoTone' | 'wail' | 'yelp'; stale ids fade out after 1 s
audio.horn(x, z, duration?)
audio.ui('click' | 'confirm' | 'back' | 'countdown' | 'go' | 'success' | 'fail' | 'cash' | 'star')
audio.setPaused(bool)
audio.setIntensity(0..5)             // music floor, e.g. the wanted level
audio.setMusicMode('game' | 'menu' | 'off')
audio.nextStation()                  // also R / tapping the radio card
audio.unlock()                       // call from a title screen's tap
audio.debug                          // state, voices, nodes, engine, music
```

To audition sounds without playing, render them offline: every recipe takes
a `Voice` on any `BaseAudioContext`, so an `OfflineAudioContext` in the dev
page can render and analyse them (`window.__ub.audio` and `__ub.events` are
exposed for emitting test events).

## Look

Everything visual outside the HUD hangs off one `Look` object
(`src/render/look.ts`): `main.ts` creates it, calls `look.update(dt, player)`
and `look.render(camera)` each frame. No real-time light is ever added or
removed (that would recompile every lit material), every program is compiled
on the first frame and again after a restored GL context (night-only meshes
included; on desktop against the HDR target the scene really draws into),
and quality-tier changes only resize or idle things. Every car model's
geometry is uploaded at load, not when that model first drives into view.

- **Draw calls.** All people are one GPU-skinned `InstancedMesh`
  (`characterModel.ts`: the GLB's 13 rigid parts merged at load, bones and
  outfit palette per person in a float texture), all cars one instanced mesh
  per model (`vehicleBatch.ts`: paint, steering, brake lights, charring and
  sirens are per-instance attributes), all contact shadows one mesh
  (`contactShadows.ts`) and all faked lights one additive mesh
  (`glowSprites.ts`: headlight beams, tail/brake lights, siren wash, the
  player marker, pickup rings). The city is ~5 instanced meshes per 256 m
  chunk. Measured in Chromium (whole frame, incl. shadow pass), iPhone
  15 Pro profile ('medium'): 40 draw calls on foot at spawn, 42–51 driving
  a busy street by day or night (each car model in view costs one call,
  plus one in the shadow pass); desktop ('high') is 54–59 including ~14
  for bloom; 'low' (no shadow map) 22–27. Programs: 15 on phones, 24 on
  desktop, none compiled after start-up over a full day. About 160–250k triangles, most of
  it the instanced city in both passes.
- **Light.** `timeOfDay.ts` (pure, tested) keyframes sun/moon direction,
  colour and strength, sky and ground fill, fog, exposure, reflection
  strength and a shared `uNight` (night keeps a strong blue moon and sky
  fill so streets stay readable on phones, which have no bloom to lift
  them); `sceneLighting.ts` applies it to one
  `DirectionalLight`, one `HemisphereLight` and a faint ambient.
  `sunShadow.ts` fits an orthographic PCF shadow box to the visible ground
  every frame, snapped to whole texels (no shimmer); map size comes from the
  tier (2048 / 1024 / off). Tone mapping is ACES plus a grade
  (`post.ts`, installed as `CustomToneMapping`: no extra pass).
- **Surfaces.** `shaderLib.ts` holds the shared uniforms (`uTime`,
  `uNight`, `uWetness` for rain later) and GLSL (integer hash, noise,
  anti-aliased lines, and `ubStreetLight`, which lights ground, walls, cars
  and people from the lamp layout in `world/streetLamps.ts` analytically).
  `world/ground.ts` draws the whole ground in one shader that follows the
  city constants exactly; `world/cityMesh.ts` draws buildings, roofs,
  rooftop props, awnings, neon, lamps and trees; `world/districts.ts` and
  `world/buildingPlans.ts` (pure, tested) decide districts, heights,
  palettes, roof types, props and shopfronts.
- **Phones vs desktop.** Phones render straight to the canvas: no
  full-screen passes, glow comes from additive sprites, a CSS vignette
  frames the view. Desktops render into a half-float buffer so the 'high'
  tier can bloom (threshold follows the time of day: only real lights bloom
  by day). Cars' paint and glass alone reflect a PMREM studio environment.

API for other systems:

```ts
look.time.set(22); look.time.speed = 0   // pin the clock (missions); speed is game hours per second
look.time.hour                           // current hour, 0..24
look.cars.setSiren(vehicle, on)          // police light bar + red/blue wash on the road
look.lighting.sky                        // current SkyState (night, exposure, ...)
worldUniforms.uWetness.value = 0..1      // wet roads (shaderLib.ts)
look.exposureBoost = 1.8                 // flash multiplier on the sky's exposure (ease it back to 1 yourself)
look.addGlowSource((glows, view) => …)   // add faked lights each frame: glows.addFlat / addUpright (glowSprites.ts)
```
